# Quiet Quitting Study


## Protocol Synopsis/Summary

Twitter ‘tweets’ were analyzed using text mining and natural language processing (NLP) algorithms such as network, sentiment, and topic analysis. Twitter handles will be used for identifying patterns, and for their content. Data was collected using the academic Twitter API 2.0, which has a monthly ‘scraping’ limit of 10 million tweets. 

To specify what information was to be collected, parameters were set using the ‘academictwitteR’ package in RStudio. Parameters and search terms included any tweet matching the criteria of matching the term 'quiet quitting' and #quiet quitting'. 

The Twitter API search query returned raw data in the form of JSON files. Currently, there is no method of removing minors, that is, those under the age of 18, from social media research. 


## Objective/Background

The objective of this study is to explore the phenomenon of quiet quitting through the analysis of tweets related to this topic. Although the term 'quiet quitting' is trendy and has recently received a lot of public attention, it’s unclear what people are generally referring to when they use the term. In other words, we ask, what exactly does it mean? 

Because the nature of this study is exploratory in nature, there were no hypotheses.

The information gleaned from this study will answer questions like: Is quiet quitting a behavior? Is quiet quitting an attitude? Is quiet quitting different from other commonly studied constructs in IO psychology academic journals? What are the common reasons and experiences associated with quiet quitting, as expressed in tweets?

By answering these questions, we add to the existing body of knowledge in the field of IO psychology by identifying a nomological framework of quiet quitting, and distinguishing quiet quitting from other workplace constructs.


## Data Access

The Twitter API 2.0 for researchers is a set of tools provided by Twitter for researchers and academic institutions to access an archive of tweets dating back to 2006. The API enables access to data such as Tweet IDs, the text of the tweets, user ID and usernames, timestamps, retweet and favorite counts, location data, and more. The academic Twitter API account enables researchers to conduct large-scale data collection with a robust rate limit of 10 million tweets per month. I have applied and been approved by Twitter, by providing information about the research project, and signing an agreement. 

Everything specified in this document is in compliance with Twitter’s terms. 


## Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria

Inclusion criteria: any individuals with a Twitter account, and the handles associated with said individuals, meet the boundaries of the inclusion criteria if their ‘tweets’ fall within the parameters specified in this document. All parameters are in line with Twitter’s researcher API guidelines. These parameters include:
- Anybody who has ‘tweeted’ since 2006, Twitter’s inception
- Anybody who tweeted hashtags such as “#quiet quitting”, and other reasonably relevant hastags that appear during preliminary search results. An example of this may be “#remote”, or “lockdown” if initial search results suggest that coronavirus is associated with quiet quitting in some way. To be clear, any ad hoc additions to hashtag search parameters will be linked and relevant to quiet quitting.
- Accounts belonging to organizations, advocacy groups, and experts in the field. 
- The United States and specific states will be included. English-speaking people of various countries are also eligible (e.g., Great Britain, Australia). Preliminary search results will inform secondary searches that contain a more managable sample size. For example, if a search query for the entire US yields 5 million tweets, we may narrow the sample to specific states.
- “Verified” Twitter status
Exclusion criteria: identifiable bots, some unverified accounts.
Currently, there is no method of removing minors, that is, those under the age of 18, from social media research. 




The IRB at the University of Central Florida cleared the included data for the public without an addendum.
